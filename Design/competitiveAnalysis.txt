Asteroids Competitive Analysis

Asteroid original version released as an arcade game in 1979

Anti features:
- 3D asteroid graphics while game is still played on a 2D surface
	- I might plan on implimenting some form of 3D graphics if I have time
	  because it sounds like a fun undertaking, however 3D is not the main
	  problem I would like to tackle
- advanced graphics in the background- I am going to keep it simple

Compelling Features:
- basic functionality of the game with asteroids surrounding a ship and
the ship having to shoot its way out of the mess
- finit lives that you can lose when you die and can regain from items
- Flying saucer bad guy ships that will come after certain times
and attack you with bullets
- Ship that will move as if it was in space. This means that the ship will 
accelerate in a direction and keep going forward with that momentum.
While the ship is heading in a direction, you can turn the direction the ship 
is pointing in without actually changing the direction of the ship's trajectory.
If you accelerate in a direction other than the current trajectory of
the ship, then you begin to change trajectory into that angle. This seems
like a hard feature to impliment because it requires creating a rudimentary
physics engine
- High Schore table
- Different game modes:
	- levels that increase difficulty as you go on
	- a survival mode where you go as long as possible
- Special items that allow you to get powerups during the game to reward
you for making it a certain time or point total.
- teleport button that you have a certain number of which will allow you to 
randomly teleport to a part of the screen if you are in a tight spot. I 
want to create a cool graphic for this feature.


Missing features:
- not a lot of the current programs have the idea of creating ships
that have customizability. There are many cool games that give you points
for your ingame performance and allow you to upgrade your ship using the 
points that you earned. To impliment this, I plan to use a server
to allow for users to create accounts and save their progress. In this way,
the game will continue even after you close the screen and it will be a 
lot more fun in my opinion.
